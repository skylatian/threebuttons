# Welcome to ThreeButtons!

ThreeButtons is meant to emulate the three physical buttons that youâ€™d find on something like a thinkpad(left, middle, right) in macOS. Why? For me, to make it easier to use Fusion360 with a trackpad when I forget a mouse.
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky" colspan="2" rowspan="2"><img src="../images/threebuttons_prefs.png"></td>
    <td class="tg-0pky" colspan="3" rowspan="4"><img src="../images/threebuttons_demo.gif" alt="image" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

### Features:
- âœ… Menu Bar item
- âœ…Â Three distinct zones on the bottom of the trackpad for left, middle, and right click
- âœ…Â Dragging while clicking
- âœ… Preview area
- âœ… Launch at login
- âœ… Disable/enable click recognition outside of zone ('Strict Zones')
- âœ… Enable/disable certain zones (for example, to just have a large right-click zone)
- âœ… Resizable zones
- âœ… Proper preferences window

### Known issues:
- ðŸš§ Power usage spikes after opening preferences window. Temporary Fix: Open preferences window, change settings, quit/re-open app. Real fix incoming.
- Dragging from one zone into another and releasing does not release original click
- Fusion360/CAD bug where pan/orbit tools are choppy until all zones are clicked once.
- Touching a zone while you've clicked elsewhere (and then releasing that other click) may cause that key to get stuck
    - Should be fixable by ignoring clicks in zones if a click already exists elsewhere/**making sure to release one type of click before starting another**

ðŸš§ = in progress

### Planned Features:
- Enable/disable two-finger right click overriding zone presence (if you two-finger right-click in any zone, toggle it counting as a right-click or being overridden by the zones)
- Program inclusion/exclusion list
- Fix known issues



# Installation
Download a binary from https://github.com/skylatian/threebuttons/releases (coming soon)
Note: I do not have an apple developer account, so the package will be unsigned and you'll have to override the system warning in Preferences -> Privacy and Security

Or, follow steps to build below.

---



### Building & Development
Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/skylatian/threebuttons.git --recurse-submodules`

Cpen `threebuttons/OpenMultitouchSupport/Framework/OpenMultitouchSupportXCF.xcodeproj`

Double click on **OpenMultitouchSupportXCF** at the top right, and go to *Signing & Capabilities*

- Change **Team** to your default team
- Change **Signing Certificate** to *Sign to Run Locally*
- Either click the run button in the top left, or do  `cd theebuttons/OpenMultitouchSupport-main && sh build_framework.sh`
    - if you ran the command, you should see the following (or something similar):
        
        ```bash
        **** BUILD SUCCEEDED ****
        xcframework successfully written out to: [some path]
        ```
Now, open the threebuttons.xcodeproj in xcode

Double click on **threebuttons** at the top right, and go to *Signing & Capabilities*

- Change **Team** to your default team
- Change **Signing Certificate** to *Sign to Run Locally*

Click build! This should run without issue. If not, Iâ€™m not sure what happened. Google around, or open an issue if you canâ€™t quite figure it out and Iâ€™ll see what I can do.
